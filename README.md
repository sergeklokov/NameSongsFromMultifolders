# NameSongsFromMultifolders
Prepare songs from several folders to burn to .mp3 disc

Let's say we have audio book on 3 CD, and we rip it on our hard drive.
We often can have file structure like this:

Disc 1
  file 1.mp3
  file 2.mp3

Disc 2
  file 1.mp3
  file 2.mp3

if we will burn it to the .mp3 CD, then we will listen in the order:
  file 1.mp3
  file 1.mp3
  file 2.mp3
  file 2.mp3

we don't want this.

And this application will copy (leave originals intact) & rename them to the root folder (where it running from) in the format:

Audio Book Name Dx Txx

Enjoy!
